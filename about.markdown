I'm starting as a  Ph.D. student in Uncertainty Quantification and Statistical Learning at the *[Research Center Trustworthy Data Science and Security (UA Ruhr)](https://rc-trust.ai/)* in February 2023. Formerly, I worked as an ML Engineer, wrangling with satellite data (mostly Synthetic Aperture Radar).
My research interests are:
- Bayesian uncertainty quantification in Deep Learning
- Efficiently estimating intractable probability densities 
- Deep Learning for Synthetic Aperture Radar data
- Calibrating predictive densities for DL tasks
- Modelling disease severity trajectories based on MRI data
- Self-supervised and unsupervised learning
